# Task manager app

A basic task manager app that I had made following a TraveryMedia YouTube tutorial. Although I had already learned React before watching this tutorial, I was a bit rusty due to not using it for quite some time; overall a refresher

## `Functionality`

You can have all of your tasks displayed out in the card-like user interface. You are able to add new tasks with properties such as a name for the task, a date for the task, and an option to be reminded about it. Also, you are able to delete a certain task when you are done with it as well.

## `Things I did`

I made the frontend UI using a basic create-react-app boilerplate template. For routing, I used the react router package, although there is very minimalistic routing. For the mock backend, I used the json server package that allowed me to emulate a rest API on my local server with CRUD operations.
